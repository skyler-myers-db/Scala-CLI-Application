# Scala CLI application

This is a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) application written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) that takes data that I implemented into my created [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) [database](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/) about [movies](https://www.imdb.com/) and allows users to query them and find out information that meets their interests. There are functions that allow users to pick movies that they may be interested in but may have fallen under the radar, but still have stelar [revies](https://www.metacritic.com/).

## Technologies used

1. [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
2. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
3. [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)
4. [JDBC](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/index.html)
5. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
6. [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
7. [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)

### Usage

The user is able to query the [backend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend) [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) [DB](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/) via the [comamand line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), using both [DDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language) & [DML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language) statements to manipulate the data as desired.
